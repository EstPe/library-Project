Today more than ever, when the whole country is back to cooking the flavors of the house, and just as the web has become an endless jumble of such and such recipes, it is more important than ever to cook where every recipe is researched, understood and tried countless times until polished to perfection. The recipes in this book can create for you a pure DNA of home cooking: good home-cooked food. You will find in it a green 'patosh' salad with avocado, chicken soup that until the end of days you will be grateful for its recipe, a mixture for the perfect kebab, polenta pastry with stretched sheep cheese, and crispy chips on the outside and soft as puree on the inside. You will find recipes that will regularly come up on your family table with dishes like chicken wings fried on chili sauce, beef bourguignon, perfect white rice, honey tortilla in a pot of wonder, rice porridge and real caramel cream.Born and raised in Jerusalem, Sheri Ansky wrote the popular food section of Maariv's 'Weekend' supplement for many years and authored six best-selling cookbooks, including 'Food' and 'Khamin,' which were published by Keter.Alex Liebek is an Israeli photographer who wins the Israel Prize, who honestly photographs uncompromising pieces of Israeli cultural life.
